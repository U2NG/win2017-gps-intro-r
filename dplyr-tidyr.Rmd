GOAL: To be able to use the 6 data frame manipulation in dplyr. 

* we select certain observations (rows) or variables (columns) 
* we often group the data by a certain variable(s), or we even calculate summary statistics 
* we can do these operations using the normal base R operations: 

### Load data

```{r}
#setwd('~/workshops/r-novice-gapminder/')
#gapminder <- read.csv("https://goo.gl/BtBnPg", header = T)
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header = T)
```

```{r}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa", "gdpPercap"])
```
```{r}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas", "gdpPercap"])

```
```{r}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", "gdpPercap"])

```

* but not great b/c there's a fair amount of repetition. 
* repeating yourself will take time and also introduce error

## dplyr package

* reduces repetition 
* introduces functions to help 
* dplyr grammar easier to read

6 verbs introduced with dplyr: 

1. select()
2. filter()
3. group_by()
4. summarize()
5. mutate()

Install this package: 

```{r results='hide'}
#install.packages('dplyr')
library(dplyr)
```

### Select 

If we want to **select** just a few varialbes in our data frame. 

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder, year, country, gdpPercap)
```

Show fig 1  in lesson. 

![](fig/13-dplyr-fig1.png)

Using pipes (`%>%`), forward pipe left to right, obviates need to include dataframe

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year,country,gdpPercap)
#base-r way
year_country_gdp_br <- gapminder[, c("year", "country", "gdpPercap")]
```

If we now wanted to move forward with the above, but only with European countries, we can combine select and filter

### Filter 

```{r}
year_country_gdp_euro <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  select(year, country, gdpPercap)

```

* above notice we pass the data from filter to select
* order of operations matter

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

```{r}
str(gapminder %>% group_by(continent))

```
