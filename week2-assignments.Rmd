```{r}
library(testit)
library(ggplot2)
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header=TRUE)

```

```{r}

w2a1 <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line()

assert("is label year", "year" == w2a1$labels$x[1])
assert("number rows in data is 1704", 1704 == nrow(w2a1$data))
## Invisible NULL if all expressions returned TRUE, otherwise an error is signalled and the user-provided message is emitted.
#if false, would throw error (not executed here b/c would stop rmarkdown build)
#assert(""number rows in data is 1704", 1705 == nrow(w2a1$data))

```

The object returned by ggplot has many different sub-lists you can grab. Lots of things to choose to test for grading. 

```{r}
str(w2a1)
```
